# Make vs Buy Interactive Dashboard
# Supply Chain Data Analytics
# Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard helps in making data-driven "Make vs Buy" decisions by analyzing cost components, supplier quotes, and in-house production capabilities. The dashboard provides three key analyses:

Supplier Cost Comparison: Evaluating quotes from four suppliers across nine products, considering different minimum volumes and unit prices.
Scenario Analysis Tool: Examining cost variations across multiple volume scenarios to identify the lowest-cost supplier dynamically.
Make vs Buy Decision Tool: Comparing in-house manufacturing costs with supplier costs to determine the optimal sourcing strategy.
Data Inputs
Supplier Quotes: Prices from four suppliers for nine products across five different minimum volumes.
Non-Recurring Expenses: One-time setup costs for both in-house production and supplier agreements.
Extended Costs: Calculated as (Unit Price × Volume) for accurate total cost estimation.
In-House Production Data:
Existing Capacity & Unit Capacity → Additional Capacity Requirement Calculation
Machine Price → Capital Investment Calculation
Extended Cost & Make Scenario Full Cost → Cost comparison with suppliers
Dashboard Sections
1. Supplier Cost Comparison
Identifies the lowest-cost supplier for each product based on minimum order volumes.
Allows users to analyze and compare total procurement costs across different suppliers.
2. Scenario Analysis Tool
Enables users to dynamically evaluate cost implications by adjusting volume levels (1,000 to 100,000 units).
Identifies the lowest-cost supplier at each volume threshold.
Displays a visual representation of cost fluctuations across suppliers.
3. Make vs Buy Decision Tool
Incorporates in-house production capabilities, factoring in capital investments, additional capacity requirements, and extended costs.
Compares the calculated Make Scenario Cost with the Buy Scenario Cost (lowest supplier quote).
Provides final recommendations on whether to make in-house or procure from a supplier based on cost avoidance.
Future Considerations
Incorporating factors like lead time, quality control, labor costs, and operational risks for a holistic decision-making approach.
Expanding cost calculations to include salaries, maintenance, and overhead costs for in-house production.
Evaluating supplier reliability and flexibility in changing demand conditions.
This dashboard serves as a strategic supply chain tool to optimize procurement decisions, reduce costs, and enhance operational efficiency.
